# Therapy Answers

This project was made for fun and is not always serious. 
Therapy Answers was created as a way to help people articulate their problems by asking questions and providing a safe place for them to think, speak, or write through them. This is based on the thinking in the rubber duck method used by programmers where having to explain your problems, or in this case answer prompts, you will gain a deeper understanding of the issue.
We don't guarantee that our "answers" will help as they are taken from a random list and may not apply to all situations. The hope is that they will encourage people to think more deeply about why they do things, how they feel, and inspire different paths of thinking.

## Project Origins
This project came out of a conversations with my brother when he gave an answer that was so like a therapist it couldn't be overlooked. We had a good laugh and came up with a scheme for this website. Initially we thought to make a gag website that was all fun and games, but it soon became a bit more serious when we thought it might be a way in which we thought someone might gain some mental clarity and get in touch with themselves and how they feel.

## Coming soon!
- we would like to come together with real therapists to create short articles on different topics that users can reference or turn to when they are struggling with certain issues to start their healing journey.
- we would also like to provide different resources created by professionals to help users gain a better understanding of their problems.
